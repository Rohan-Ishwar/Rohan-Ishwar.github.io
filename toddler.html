            It's important to remember that every child develops at their own
            pace, so not all toddlers will reach these milestones at the same
            time. Parents and caregivers play a crucial role in supporting a
            toddler's growth and development by providing a safe and nurturing
            environment and encouraging their exploration and learning.
